Conclustion 
============

  By creating a CSS recipe and, in particular, the development of two components, we have demonstrated the excellent modularity feature of SCS and how developers can extend it to one's particular need. The form results from two factors: excellent code quality and modularity with dependency injection and API design, plus strong support from the core developers, as we showed in the review chapter.
  Contrary to SolidOs, which comes with a wide range of built-in features, SCS comes with a bare minimum to run a solid server. However, it provides the building block to create one's own tailor-made Solid server solution. For that reason, CSS depends more than NSS on the community and the surrounding ecosystem. 

We have shown that this ecosystem lacks maturity. Nevertheless, as community and enthusiasm grow around Solid and its community server, more components and UIs should be available for CSS, from which CERN could benefice. 
SCS is still a young software made for experimental purposes, but it has all the potential to mature from experimental software to a production-ready solution.

 Currently, a UI still needs to be found for CERN's CSS instance. Two options are presented to the CERN, either use already existing UI, even if it needs some work to fix compatibility issues. For each UIs, we found the root cause of the issue in the [TODO UI chapter] ). The option to build its own UI is also available, and we have a simple UI to ease the bootstrapping of such an initiative.

As the most prominent international scientific organization and the birthplace of the Web, CERN's notoriety in new technologies is not to be proven. However, by adopting qualitative software such as CSS as a Solid server, CERN will hold to its reputation.

Even if one can argue that the web is facing a crisis on data and user privacy, it is good knowing that robust solutions are developed to build a more prolific and ethical world wide web.
