# Building a CSS recipe for CERN

As we explained earlier, CSS is built with a dependency injection called components.js. It allows CSS to take a different shape regarding a chosen configuration. We will call *recipe* a particular components.js configuration. This chapter is about the recipe we built for CERN's CSS instance. First, we will showcase a component we built to improve the CSS registration page and then the storage configuration. Finally, after analyzing and drawing conclusions on the available UIs, we will showcase another component we coded for our recipe: a minimalistic profile viewer.
