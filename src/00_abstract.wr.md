Abstract {-}
========

Solid, for **So**cial **Li**nked **D**ata, is a new web standard that gives users control over their online data. Developed by the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, it aims to decouple web applications from data. In a Solid environment, users own a Personal Online Datastore (Pod) and consume solid-apps. A solid-app is a zero data web application that is connected to the user's Pod and reads or writes data on the user Pod instead of its database.

CERN, the birthplace of the Web, is interested in Solid and has defined a project to investigate how Solid could be used inside CERN's infrastructure. In particular, CERN shows interest in deploying its Solid server. A Solid server's goal is mainly to serve Pods and handle authentification through an Identity Provider ( IDP ). Community Solid Server ( CSS ), released in August 2021, is one of the first open-source Solid servers that implement the Solid specification [css readme]. The central goal of this thesis is to investigate CSS as a solution for CERN's Solid server needs by deploying a CSS instance inside CERN's infrastructure.

The investigation concludes that even if CSS, and mostly its ecosystem, lack maturity, CSS is a software of high quality, with remarkable plasticity and a viable long-term solution for CERN to a certain discussed extent.
