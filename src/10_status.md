# CSS current status

In this section, we will discuss the current status of CSS toward UI and Single-Sign-On ( SSO ) compatibility. First, we will investigate CSS compatibility with CERN's SSO provider Keycloak, particularly a proxy solution developed by Digita. Then we will analyse, compare and test potential UI for CSS, as CSS comes default without ( or a very minimalistic ) UI. We will draw conclusion on the available UIs.
